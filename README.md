This is a simple remote control car program running in rapsberry pi 3 b+.
The program launch a simple tcp server and broadcast the server ip & port via UDP.
After the remote controller(Android Device) connectted the tcp server, the program also setup a rtsp server for controller.
The rtsp server will send the video(H.264) of the V4l2 device to client.

It's the toy for my little girl Nico.
Hope she like this well and be proud of his dad.
